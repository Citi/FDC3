In addition to intent and context events, the FDC3 API may be used to listen for other types of events via the `addEventListener()` function.

## `EventHandler`

```ts
type EventHandler = (event: FDC3Event) => void;
```

Describes a callback that handles non-context and non-intent events. Provides the details of the event. 

Used when attaching listeners to events. 

**See also:**
- [`DesktopAgent.addEventListener`](DesktopAgent#addEventListener)
- [`FDC3Event`](#fdc3event)

## `FDC3EventType`
```ts
enum FDC3EventType {
  USER_CHANNEL_CHANGED = "USER_CHANNEL_CHANGED"
}
```

Enumeration defining the types of (non-context and non-intent) events that may be received via the FDC3 API's `addEventListener` function. 

**See also:**
- [`DesktopAgent.addEventListener`](DesktopAgent#addEventListener)

## `FDC3Event`

```ts
interface FDC3Event {
  readonly type: FDC3EventType;
  readonly details: any;
}
```

Type representing the format of event objects that may be received via the FDC3 API's `addEventListener` function. Will always include both `type` and `details`, which describe type of the event and any additional details respectively.

**See also:**
- [`DesktopAgent.addEventListener`](DesktopAgent#addEventListener)
- [`FDC3EventType`](#fdc3eventtype)


### `FDC3ChannelChangedEvent`
```ts
interface FDC3ChannelChangedEvent extends FDC3Event {
  readonly type: FDC3EventType.USER_CHANNEL_CHANGED;
  readonly details: {
    currentChannelId: string | null
  };
}
```

Type representing the format of USER_CHANNEL_CHANGED events. The identity of the channel joined is provided as `details.currentChannelId`, which will be `null` if the app is no longer joined to any channel.
